Yesterday I updated my kernel on my laptop after a record uptime (for me on my laptop anyways ;)):

    16:26:58 up 42 days,  7:21,  3 users,  load average: 1.12, 1.46, 1.04

42 days without an update to the kernel in Ubuntu... I dunno if thats good or bad. But one thing that is really cool is that in all this time I used my suspend to ram function, and the laptop haven't died on me once. It occasionally did in all the previous versions of Ubuntu. So I just wanna send a kudos to the developers.

But this time I was excited because I noticed that the kernel apparently had a fix for the [bug reading large SD cards][1] I mentioned in [an earlier post][2].

I can confirm that this is now fixed... YAY!

Anyways... im now gonna put [an encrypted file system on the SD card][3] for my gpg key, ssh key, VPN keys etc. I hope I can give it another label as well.
