Just wanted to say that now magically danish special characters works. Dunno what I did ( or didn't ), and I don't care. My good friend Pierre (I wish I had a link I could  throw at you) told me that I can use "Num Lock" to make activate autorun. So now World of Warcraft pretty much works just like in Windows.

Perhapes because I'm colored (pro Linux) or perhapes because I havn't patched Windows for a long time (and it havn't been reinstall for for a couple of years). But World of Warcraft feels better running under Linux :-)
