AI tries to make everything easy... convenient,
but life without discomfort is not something to desire.
The label 'PC compatible' is a reminder of how complex (inconvenient) things can be.

I can't help but feel stupid with all the AI hype.
What is it that everybody else sees that I cannot?
So, obviously,
it warmed my heart when Rich Hickey wrote a (sarcastic) ["Thank you"-letter to AI][1].
At least, being stupid together with Rich isn't the worst thing I can think of.

A forced segway is that AI offers convenience, but:

> Annoyance, inconvenience, and unpredictability are not flaws in community.
> They are the cost of entry.

Read *[Everyone wants a village, but no one wants to be a villager][3]*
by The Minority Report Publication (Kasper Benjamin Reimer Bjørkskov?)  
— truly inspiring writing.<!-- This is soo good I saved a copy in case it would ever disappear -->
It made me search for the author's name, which led me to the talk titled
[How to turn minority insight into majority action][4] at the IDG Summit 2025.  
Also worth a watch.

Reading *[What is a PC compatible?][2]* by Matthew Garrett was a trip down memory lane.
The first computer I had almost unbounded access to was an 80386.
But Matthew's story about the PC, all the way back from the 8086 chip,
was fascinating.
