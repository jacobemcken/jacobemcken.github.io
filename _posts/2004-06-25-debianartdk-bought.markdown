Last night I bought the domain debianart.dk. I'm hoping to put a site togeter which only focus on graphics for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. Like wallpapers, splashscreens, icons etc.

I will have to setup a homepage for this and apart from a gallery/download page I was thinking of adding a wiki page where we can write documentation/tutorials for specific styles of icons, wallpapers etc.

Let's se how it goes :)
