<p>Yesterday I installed <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ubuntulinux.org&#47;">Ubuntu Linux<&#47;a> - at first view a great distribution. I havn't replaced my Debian installation (yet), but I must say that Ubuntu seems to have excatly what I have missed in Debian.</p>
<p> * Release cycle that I can use (every six months)<br />
 * GNOME focus<br />
 * A slick finish</p>
<p>I resized an NTFS partition from my harddrive to release 8GB of space. I rarely use Windows and if I took the time, I could release alot of unused space locked to a NTFS partition.<br />
The Ubuntu installation went smooth and tonight I will try to upgrade the <i>Warty Warthog<&#47;i> to <i>Hoary Hedgehog<&#47;i></p>
<p>I'm looking forward to se how GNOME 2.10 is comming up.</p>
