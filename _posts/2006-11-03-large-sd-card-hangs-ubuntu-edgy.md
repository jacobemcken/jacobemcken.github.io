  content: Yeah I have the same problem.  You have an X40?  I can read my 256mb card
    just fine, but my not my 2gb card.  It's a bummer, but I just use my camera as
    an SD reader.

Damn... never brag about uptime :-(

Today I received a 2GB SD card which I'm going to use to store ssh and gpg keys on. Of cause I'm going to [encrypt it][1] like I wrote about some days ago. When I inserted the SD card into my laptop everything just froze... it guess I'm hit by [bug #61758][2].
Ubuntu Edgy uses kernel 2.6.17 which seems to be affected by this bug. It should be fixed in 2.6.18 though.

I'll try to patch my kernel module... god I hoped those days where over. Exciting to see if I can even remember how to do it. I hope this gets fixed soon, life is to short to compile kernel modules. My laptop should just work.
