I really wanted to attend <a href="http://2005.guadec.org/">GUADEC</a> but the trip gets to expensive because I don't have a car. I'm really interested in the GNOME development not to mention Ubuntu which uses GNOME as base for the desktop.
I had planned to go with 2 friends (and colleauges) of mine, and I know the trip would have been awsome. My boss even gave me 2 free days off so I could attend the conference in worktime. I really hope the GUADEC people do something extra for all of us who wont be able to attend on location.
