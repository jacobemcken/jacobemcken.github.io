With a little help, [aws-simple-sign now supports PUT URLs][1]
and I have released a new version (`2.1.0`) of the library.

I noticed a few issues with some of the examples in the README
which are now also fixed.

For those unfamiliar with [`aws-simple-sign`][2],
it generates presigned URLs for S3 objects
and signs HTTP requests for AWS.
It doesn't require any dependencies (Java or otherwise)
which is pretty handy for using it with Babashka.

Enjoy ðŸš€
