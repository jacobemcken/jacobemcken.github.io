After yesterdays small data loss I have been working hard tonight to prepare the site for the update that I have been working on for so long now. All the pieces seem to have fallen together now and the new site seems to be running just fine.

The transission to <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a> and an enchanced data structure was hard work, but I hope that it eventually will pay off. I have made a small update to <a href="http://www.debianart.dk/submissions/any/oldest/">the 3 old wallpapers</a>. I have removed my email from them which was tagged on the lower left corner.

Next step(s) for the Debianart website:
* Different sorting of submissions (oldest, top downloads etc.)
* Graphics and news submissions directly from users
* Give me your ideas!!!

Now I'm tired :)
