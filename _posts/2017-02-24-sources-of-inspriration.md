I find work-related inspiration in many places, among others, colleagues
meetups and conferences. But most inspiration comes while purposelessly
roaming the internet. I've always been interested in more than
writing the code for the software. Whether it be participating in
meetings and discussions that would help me better understand the
business. Gathering data to predict how a UI should be formed for
optimal user experience. Learning how to avoid making poor software
design decisions that would bring the nice people in operations in
trouble. But also the softer things like how culture and circumstances
affect us as developers and individuals.

Prior to getting the responsibility for a team, all the above would just
be archived mentally as "work/software development". These days, stuff
related to work culture and people has earned its own archive
label. Suddenly these things have a slightly different meaning to me.

Before I was laughing when seeing/reading things like these (and I
still do):

- [Don't interrupt a programmer][1]
- [Joining a project that has legacy code][2]
- [The Seven Circles of Developer Hell][3]

Now failing to do my job properly... the joke will be on me.

To get to the core of the matter. I would like to share the following
links because they either gave me food for thought or just solidified
my view on matters:

- [The Psychology of Programming][4]
- [The First Rule of Programming: It's Always Your Fault][5]
- [How terrible code gets written by perfectly sane people][6]
