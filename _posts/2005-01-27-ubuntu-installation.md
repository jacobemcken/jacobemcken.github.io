Yesterday I installed <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu Linux</a> - at first view a great distribution. I havn't replaced my Debian installation (yet), but I must say that Ubuntu seems to have excatly what I have missed in Debian.

 * Release cycle that I can use (every six months)
 * GNOME focus
 * A slick finish

I resized an NTFS partition from my harddrive to release 8GB of space. I rarely use Windows and if I took the time, I could release alot of unused space locked to a NTFS partition.
The Ubuntu installation went smooth and tonight I will try to upgrade the <i>Warty Warthog</i> to <i>Hoary Hedgehog</i>

I'm looking forward to se how GNOME 2.10 is comming up.
