... working on a <a href="http://www.shaolinmicro.com/">Aptus server</a> which I have to have ready tomorrow for at customer. It serves so called 'fit clients', and I like the concept... though I wouldn't (probably never) trade my favorite distro.... Debian :-D
Aptus only works with distos like SUSE and Redhat.

Well.... hurray!
It works - *everybody cheering* - I must be tired.
I'll better finish this up so I can get home and get some sleep.
