I went skiing for a week with my parents and my little brother in Sweden (Idre Fj&auml;ll). Really nice place I think - not that big though. I both skiied and snowboarded and hurt myself alot. Jumps in high speed have a magnetic effect on me... I dunno why?!

It is a long time since I have been eating so much candy and so many cookies... and I cannot deny that it didn't have an effect on my stomach. Anyway I got alot of reading done which happens rarely (Read: It only happens when I'm nowhere near a computer)
I read <i>Star Wars: Han Solo trioligy</i> which I find a good (If you like Star Wars that is).
But it was on my vacation that it came to me that I wanted a blog. Perhapes it was the abstinence from not being near my computers or perhapes it was the freash air I inhaled for a change... anyway here it is.

It is nice to be home and get to do an <b>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -u upgrade</b> on my Debian machines. YE YE
