On my way to work I got a crazy thought. IIRC at least 3 questions about how to set time and date has been asked on <a href="http://www.debianforum.dk/">the danish Debian help forum</a>. This should be addressed with writing a section about how to set date and time on a Debian box. The section should contain a little info about `date`, `rdate` with cron and a third command to set the date (which I can't remember the name of).
