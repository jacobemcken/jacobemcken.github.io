The bug I blogged about in a [previous post][1] seems to [be known][2]. I googled on the the problem and found a [few][3] [links][4] which seems to describe my exact problem. The good thing is that there is a work around. I'll try this later.

Hope it gets fixed soon :)

**Update:** I found out why VMware wouldn't start and made [a post about it][5].
