  content: So, as a person with WoW actually running on Ubuntu, how would you advise
    a novice (if at all) who is having install problems?  Ubuntu, check.  WINE, check.  WoW,
    check.  Installing...  blargh.  CD changing issues.  What was your process?

  content: "Hi Chris,\r\n\r\nI remember I had issues with the CD changing but it is
    long time ago so I dont remeber the excat problem and how I solved it. But my
    guess would be that I used a terminal to unmount and mount the new CD's.\r\n\r\nRemember
    that when you unmount a CD, no resources can be using it. Ie. if you have a terminal
    open which stands within a directory on the CD, the computer sees the CD as busy
    and it cannot be unmounted.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could just copy the entire
    installation from a windows partition (if you have one)."

... down a drain called World of Warcraft.

As a few people have pointed out, I havn't blogged for some time now. I spend most my evenings playing World of Warcraft and havn't really used my spare time on all sorts Open Source stuff as I used to.

This is [my character][1] so far. It is actually now pretty easy to get WoW running under Linux with WINE.

But at work I have tried to update our [Instiki][2] installation to the newest 0.11 version which wasn't as easy as it may sound. I finally got all the old stuff migrated and all seemed to work until we tried to proxy from our DMZ to the internal Instiki wiki. Instiki didn't like that... I is some time ago now so I dont have the error message. But if I stumble upon it I'll put it here.

Instead I found a Media Wiki altered by [MindTouch][3] called [dekiwiki][4].

The cool thing about that wiki is they made a page where you can get you [own public readable wiki][5], I already made my own at [emcken.wiki.com][6]. Not much for you guys, but now have a place for all my notes and shit which usually just lie around on my disk until it dissappears in all the other mess.
