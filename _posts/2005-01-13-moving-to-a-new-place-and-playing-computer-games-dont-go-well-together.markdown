<p>I have been busy lately unpacking boxes and trying to keep up at work. My computer and cable TV is ofcourse up and running, and the last two days I played a little <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.worldofwarcraft.com&#47;">World of Warcraft<&#47;a> to take my mind of work. Work and getting settled have taken all my time, and when you finally have som spare time you feel guilty not unpacking, cleaning or some other meaningfull moving-to-new-appartment releated stuff. I havn't even played the new Pirates by Sid Meier more than a few hours and I miss having time to write guides to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.debianguiden.dk&#47;">danish Debian guide<&#47;a>, generaly just play around with Debian.</p>
<p>I had time to setup my IP-telephone box though, and it works like a charm. Now I only need somebody to call heh. I'm looking forward to the weekend which I will spend together with my girlfriend friday, some friends saturday and again my girlfriend sunday.<br />
Last weekend wasn't much of a weekend. I had to work all saturday setting up a new server, and I had trouble getting the hardware to play along with Debian Sarge. When I was finally reaching the point where I could head home, all public transport was stopped because a great storm has hit Denmark. I sat (alone) at the small office with my laptop (and a server which refused to let me use hardware RAID 0+1) the whole night. You should know that it REALLY SUCKED - heh. Luckily I had a few movies on my laptop... have you watched the Alias series with Jennifer Garner? I recommend it!</p>
<p>Since the last post I have also recieved my 10 Ubuntu CD's. They are really nice.... well back to relaxing.</p>
