Still can't get Postfix to save my mail in Maildir format :-(
It seems that Postfix don't have permission to save the emails where I directed it to, even though it should. And of top of it all Courier-IMAP won't authendicate via MySQL.

But this sucker ain't going to get me down... I will fight to the end. Eventualy I will get reinforcements :)

Thor, Per, Steffen... HELP!
