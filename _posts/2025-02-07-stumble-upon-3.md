Even if you're open-minded and free from bad habits and addictions,
I believe you'll find the following a great source of inspiration,
just as I did.

Dr. Anna Lembke, a dopamine expert, is interviewed by [Steve Bartlett on his podcast DOAC][3].
Steve highlights this episode as particularly significant,
and I completely agree
— it offers valuable perspective on several important topics like addiction and bad habits.

Either [watch the episode on YouTube][1] or find it in your favorite podcast app.
The episode title relies on clickbait tactics,
giving off a low-quality vibe that doesn’t do the episode justice.
That's why I will refrain from sharing the title
and instead suggest you search for *“DOAC dopamine”*.

Another resource in the self-insight category:
I rediscovered the book *"[Think Again][2]"* in my Audible library
and found re-listening to it highly engaging.
I wish schools did a better job of teaching children this approach to learning.
*Think Again* offers a great perspective on being open-minded and life in general.
