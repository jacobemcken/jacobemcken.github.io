I have been looking for a portable DVD/CD drive to add the only function my laptop dosn't have. Thought it was on purpose I bought it without a DVD/CD drive. I rarely have use for such a drive and I wanted my laptop to be as small as possible (Debian is installable with an USB key). At home I could use a CD-burner but again this is only a function a rarely use and until now have managed to deal with in alternative ways.

But now I'm thinking of installing Ubuntu on my laptop and for that I need a CD-drive. I could borrow one at work, but I think the time has come to buy one myself.

I have found this <a href="http://www.aopen.nl/Products/dvd+rw/esv-289u.htm">slick AOpen drive</a> which I think would look good besides my IBM X40 :-D

I have also found some addinional pictures of the drive in the <a href="http://www.3dgameman.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25923">3D Game Man forum</a>.
