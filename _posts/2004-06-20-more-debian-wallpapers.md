After making my first wallpaper I got a lot of idears I wanted to realize... and now I have (for some of them).
I have added two new wallpapers to my <a href="/public/files/">files section</a> called '<i>First love</i>' (the red) and '<i>Natures gift</i>' (the green). You can see a thumb of them right here in this post.

My first wallpaper I also uploaded to <a href="http://gnome-look.org/">GNOME-look.org</a> and I have allready had almost 200 downloads. This is cool :)
