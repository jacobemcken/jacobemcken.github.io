Every time I make a homepage I try to use tableless design and css and every time Internet Explorer craps my homepage totally up! Microsoft can bundle their browser as much they want but with their market share they should a least show some responsibility and provide the masses with a standard compilant browser.

Just needed to get needed to get my anger out :)
Sorry!

<i>UPDATE: The thing I was fiddeling with was a proposal for a new frontpage for <a href="http://www.debianguiden.dk/">debianguiden.dk</a></i>

BTW. try download <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla FireFox</a>, which is a great browser. You can find it in Debians testing and unstable repository with the package name <i>mozilla-firefox</i>.
