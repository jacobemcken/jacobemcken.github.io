While doomscrolling on LinkedIn the other day,
a comment linking to an article/essay about
what to expect from the newly inaugurated U.S. president and his administration
caught my eye.

The essay, [What Should the World Expect from Trump 2.0?][1],
was written by Lene Rachel Andersen.

I try not to react in the heat of the moment
to avoid inadvertently “endorsing” something
I might not stand by after a closer look.
So, I simply saved the link for later reading.

Today, I finally had time to read it
and found a well-written and thoughtful essay.

Unfortunately, I can’t find the original LinkedIn comment anymore,
but I’m sharing the article here on my blog.
It deserves a response. 👍

I’ve saved it as a PDF, just in case it disappears from the web (as things sometimes do).

On a less serious note, I also had the pleasure to read Benjamin Schwerdtner thoughts about
[why Clojure is such a cool language][2]:

I think he captures it better than I ever could:

> Language is a tool of thought.
