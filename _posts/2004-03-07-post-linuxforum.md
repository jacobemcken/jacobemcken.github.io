Wheeew... it was two great days.
I meet Morten from <a href="http://www.debianguiden.dk/">debianguiden.dk</a> which I had been looking forward.

Peter Toft introduced me to Jacob Nordfalk who have written a few <a href="http://javabog.dk/">Java books</a>. He was interested in helping out with FriFinans and he clarified a few things for me and commented on the code.

Overall today was just a relaxing day with my girlfriend whom I have neglected the last couple of days.
