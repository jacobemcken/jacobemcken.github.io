When I came home from work today I read [Planet Gnome][pgo], I usually visit Planet Gnome several times a day so nothing new in that.
But this time I found the post "[tsclient 0.150 - call for translators][1]" post by [Jonh Wendell][2].

I thought why not... even tough I always use the English language when ever I can get away with it.
I use [tsclient][] a lot at work so I guess it was about time I payed something back to this great program.

I found an old Danish translation back from version 0.106 in the SVN repository, and started from there.
I used a [Danish translation guide][3] translation guide since this is the first time I've ever translated software.
This guide linked to a nice [word list for Danish translations][4] which helped me a few places where I was unsure about which Danish word I should choose. About 2 hours later I was finished and had [submitted the translation][translation] in a bug report.

I hope someone will find this useful out there.
