Today I went to se the new grand shopping center <a href="http://www.fields.dk/">Fields</a> just opened in Denmark.
I got some new T-Shirts and I bought <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/jak2/index.html">Jak II - Renegade</a> for 199DKK ~ 27&euro; (today on <a href="http://www.xe.com/">xe.com</a>)

I played it for about an hour and I'm impressed! Allready from start it is alot more variated than the first game. I seems alot more like <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i> which I think is good.
