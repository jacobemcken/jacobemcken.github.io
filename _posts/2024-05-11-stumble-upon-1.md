While roaming the internet for information on different topics,
I also found a few totally unrelated posts, but interesting nevertheless.
I guess that's what happens when you indulge:<br/>
*I wonder what else they wrote about?*

Apparently, "AWS presigned URLs" led to Roko‚Äôs Basilisk:
[How My University Condemned Me to Eternal Torture?][1] by *Doƒüu Deniz Uƒüur*.
A little philosophy never hurt anyone? üêâ

Another search, this time for "Babashka", led to the author Elif ≈ûafak:
[The 40 rules of loving Elif ≈ûafak][2] by *Josh Glovers*.
I guess I need to read one of her books now, Josh "sold it" very convincingly.

Not all my time online is spent roaming,
some is very deliberately used visiting [Planet Clojure][5].
This time around, I rediscovered [Eric Normand and his substack][4] (which he revived in late 2023).
I feel that I can relate to many of the things he writes about,
e.g. Dilbertism and technical debt to name a few.

A few non-Clojure things that also resonate with me strongly,
are the episode [*How to create cultures of growth*][3] on the *You are not so smart* podcast,
and [an article about Marlene who inherited ‚Ç¨25m and asked 50 strangers to decide how to spend it][6].
The article is in Danish, but you can find [more about Marlene Engelhorn on Wikipedia][7].

On a closing note, I want to share my frustration with AI image generation.
I tried very hard to get the AI to generate different pictures
either of someone stumbling, a foot tripping on cobblestones or someone taking a detour.
The above featured-image was the "best" image I was able to generate,
which I associate with the words *"stumble upon"*.
I guess there is still some way to go, for either the Midjourney AI or my AI magic foo skillz
‚Äî but probably both.
