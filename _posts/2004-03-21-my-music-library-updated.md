  the music player inspired by iTunes. I had head that it was good... and so far I'm
  not dissapointed.\r\n\r\nThis cool player made me want some new music so I surfed
  the net for some new stuff. My music taste is pretty broard so I ended up with this:\r\nMew

  Eyed Peas - Elephunk (cd-wow)\r\nBritney Spears - In The Zone (cd-wow)\r\n\r\nIt
  is really crappy that <a href=\"http://www.cd-wow.com/\">CD-WOW</a>
  had to raise their prices... yes I know why but it's still sad. Now that I found
  a job so I can actually buy my music they go and pull a stunt like this. :(\r\n\r\nCD-WOW
  has far from all music so I have to supplement with <a href=\"http://www.cdon.com/\">CDON</a>
  ( a nordic online music reseller).\r\nI have to look for some price indexes and
  alternative sites to buy music so that I can get it as cheap as possible :)\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing I don't like is the fact that I haven't found a decent download music shop
  to use. TDC has started a music shop but it only works in IE and with Windows Media
  Player AFAIK :( <b>Crap site!</b>\r\nI want to buy my music! Why do they have
  to make it so hard?\r\n\r\n\n"

Today I found some time to try out <a href="http://www.rhythmbox.org/">Rhythmbox</a> the music player inspired by iTunes. I had head that it was good... and so far I'm not dissapointed.

This cool player made me want some new music so I surfed the net for some new stuff. My music taste is pretty broard so I ended up with this:
Mew - Frengers (cdon)
Creed - Weathered (cdon)
Oasis - Heathen Chemistry (cdon)
Black Eyed Peas - Elephunk (cd-wow)
Britney Spears - In The Zone (cd-wow)

It is really crappy that <a href="http://www.cd-wow.com/">CD-WOW</a> had to raise their prices... yes I know why but it's still sad. Now that I found a job so I can actually buy my music they go and pull a stunt like this. :(

CD-WOW has far from all music so I have to supplement with <a href="http://www.cdon.com/">CDON</a> ( a nordic online music reseller).
I have to look for some price indexes and alternative sites to buy music so that I can get it as cheap as possible :)

Another thing I don't like is the fact that I haven't found a decent download music shop to use. TDC has started a music shop but it only works in IE and with Windows Media Player AFAIK :( <b>Crap site!</b>
I want to buy my music! Why do they have to make it so hard?

I'm thinking of buying some of these in the future:
Linking Park
Nickelback
Gigi D'argostino
Swan Lee
Christina Aguilera
Scooter
Safri Duo
Franz Ferdinand

and a lot of other stuff :)
