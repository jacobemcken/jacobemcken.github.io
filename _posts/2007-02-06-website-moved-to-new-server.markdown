<p>As of right now I have moved my website to new server out in town on a 100MBit line, so it should be fairly fast. This is the first step in shutting down my server at home entirely. Lets see how it works out.</p>
<p>*crossing my fingers and praying to the internet gods*</p>
<p>**Update:** Now [debianart.dk][1] have been moved as well.</p>
