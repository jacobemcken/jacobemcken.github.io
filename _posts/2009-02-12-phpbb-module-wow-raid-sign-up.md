Ever since my guild in World of Warcraft first introduced a system for raid sign ups I wished that it was integrated into the forum so I wouldn't have to login to the forum with one user and the raid sign up system with another (and into the dkp system with a third).

Anyway a little over a year ago I became responsible for the guild forum and looked for a mod for [phpBB][1] so raid sign ups would integrate well with the forum. I couldn't find anything usable at the time so I decided to try [write my own phpBB raid sign up mod][2].

Apart from being fun this little project kept my php skills from rusting totally and I also learned to use [Bazaar][3] (a version control system).

Just wanted to blog about it because I think it turned out quite good even though its small. Sure there is room for improvements but hey... the source is there for everybody - change it if you like :D
