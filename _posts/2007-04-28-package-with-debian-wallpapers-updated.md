For those who doesn't know... a few years back I made the site [www.debianart.dk][1] which was supposed to be the center of graphics for Debian. It never took off, mostly because I didn't really have the time and it didn't help that I started using Ubuntu instead. I was running Debian unstable at the time because I wanted the latest and greatest (Gnome among other things) so the jump to Ubuntu wasn't really that big.

Now I use the debianart.dk to host my own Debian wallpapers which I'm actually quite proud of :)
Even though I use Ubuntu now for my laptop and workstation, I still use my own wallpapers (mostly "apt-get install").

Right before my interest died for debianart.dk I made a Debian package with all the four wallpapers I have made public. Once installed they would automatically be available when changing background in Gnome. A later version of Gnome changed the location of where you should register background images, and I never got it updated... until now. I got an email from a guy asking how the Debian package worked, which made me pull my head of of my ass and get the update done :)
