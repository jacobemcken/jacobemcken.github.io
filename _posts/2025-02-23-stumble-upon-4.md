A little while ago, I was presented with an old 2016 blog post
by Ricardo J. Mendez on [Planet Clojure][1] titled
*[Complexity is the mind-killer][2]*.
Planet Clojure occasionally resurfaces older posts
when their 'updated timestamp' is refreshed,
which is likely what happened.
While not always ideal, this time, I felt lucky. 🍀

It wasn't until I finished reading this brilliant piece,
that I noticed its age
— a testament to its timeless relevance.

The fact that it reminded me of *Dune* only made it better:

> I must not fear.
> **Fear is the mind-killer.**
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
> I will face my fear.
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
> And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

*― Frank Herbert, Dune*

For me, things seem to be converging around the theme "complexity"
and how important it is to minimize it.
A couple of months ago, I wrote about how [static types can delay dealing with complexity][3], and more recently, Eric Normand wrote about [the difficulty of working in a codebase][4] on his Substack.

Ricardo authored several other insightful posts,
but I particularly want to highlight *[Centralization Is a Fragile Thing][5]*.
