I ventured far and wide on my Clojure Jekyll adventure right after the last check-in.
Then, fatigue (and life) caught up with me,
and I had to set up camp for a little while.

The other day, I went on a little side quest and officially released
my fork's changes to the Liquid templating library [Wet üíß][1].

This is the third part of the series: ["A Clojure Jekyll adventure"][2].
If you‚Äôre curious about what happened on the previous part of my journey,
check out: [Getting my feet wet with Liquid][3].
<!--more-->

The library is now at version `0.3.0`, indicating that new features have been added,
but I still don't think it is ready to be tagged as version 1.0.0.

For a quick recap, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:

- `render` tag with parameters, allowing to isolate reusable template parts.
- `comment` tag, because not everything needs to end up in the "final product".
- `empty` type for assertions like: {% raw %}`{% if coll == empty %}`{% endraw %}

I put some [serious effort into cracking *"Whitespace control"*][4]
(stripping unnecessary adjacent whitespaces controlled by special Liquid tags),
but it proved to be a tough nut.
I suspect it will take fundamental changes to the original implementation to get it right
without overcomplicating the code.
However, it might just be me
‚Äî I still don‚Äôt fully understand the Wet library and Instaparse.
Any help would be much appreciated!

As I teased earlier, I also made significant progress on the Clojure Jekyll clone.
But after being defeated by 'Whitespace control',
I needed some time to recover before I had the energy to write a blog post.

Originally, I planned to share details about the clone's progress in this post,
but it became too lengthy and unfocused,
so I decided to dedicate a separate blog post to it instead.

Stay tuned.

Plus, I get to create another awesome picture for it with Midjourney. üñºÔ∏è
