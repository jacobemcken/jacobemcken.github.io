In order to support different syntax for posts, smileys and hook-ins in general I searched the web for inspiration and found the following link which have some cool info:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10272559/how-best-to-structure-and-build-clojure-apps-with-plugins

I've started small and decided to support changing the post content via a hook-in before handing it over to the html generator Enlive. The way it works is by registering any number of functions which can transform post content in a chain (vector).
Zero functions means no transformation and the post content is serves as-is.

Here is some example code which can demo the thoughts behind the design so far:


``` clojure
(defonce changes (atom []))

(defn reg-change
  "Registers a fn (change) to a hook"
  [hook-name f]
  (swap! hook-name conj f))

(defn apply-changes
  "Applies all changes in the vector to the input"
  [change-vec input]
  (reduce #(%2 %1) input @change-vec))

(apply-changes changes "Test is good")

(defn good-is-bad [text] (clojure.string/replace text "good" "bad"))

(reg-change changes good-is-bad)

(apply-changes changes "Test is good")
```
