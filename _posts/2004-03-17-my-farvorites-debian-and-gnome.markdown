A new beta of the Sarge <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">Debian-Installer</a> has been released and I must say that I'm impressed :) Soon I will be able to make all my friends try it!

USB CD-ROM drives, USB keys, SATA disks nothing is stopping this new installer!
Try it!

The developers are moving closer to the next stable release of Debian (Sarge):
Wed Mar 17 08:00:00 UTC 2004

Release-critical bugs in unstable: 502
Release-critical bugs in testing: 201 (and still counting down)

An other great thing is that the 2.6 version of Gnome will be released on 25. march... I can't wait!
