    Emcken. Have you notized, I have already grown my grey hair? I'\r\nm sure you
    have. Well, I only hope that I will be perceived as distinguished in a couple
    of years....\r\n\r\nBack on topic: Congrats on your new sleek machine.\r\nI mentioned
    objects of envy in a previous comment. And yes, I do envy your little bastard
    of a machine. But I wouldn't change it for my beloved Apple iBook B4. :-)\r\nI
    believe things are as they are supposed to be.... besides our hair turning grey."

Today (or yesterday because it is early morning) my IBM X40 laptop arrived. There is no CD-ROM drive within it so I used an USB stick to install Debian Sarge which installed with no problems. I used <a href="http://d-i.pascal.at/">a guide</a> on found on <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">Debian-Installer</a> website.
I have also checked on <a href="http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/ibm.html">http://linux-laptop.net/</a> for info about my new laptop.

I deletede Windows XP and the IBM rescue partition... though no CD-ROM's with this software came along with the laptop. I'll have to find out how to get it back... not because I'm going to use it but now that I payed for it I'll like to have it :)

No I'm off to bed... got a though day tomorrow. I'm on a crappy organized assignment (partly my own fault) and I think I'm starting to grow grey hair because I'm missed my beauty sleep for some days now.
