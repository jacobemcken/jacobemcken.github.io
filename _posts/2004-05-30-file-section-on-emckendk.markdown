I have been planing to put a file section on my website for some time now. Earlier I just posted files in my weblog but evntually they dissapear into the archives of the weblog and therefore not easily accessable. From now on I will put files in my new <a href="http://www.emcken.dk/files/">file section</a> if their relevance is beyond a single post in my blog.

For the file section I have found some code on <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/">phpclasses</a>.
The <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse.html/package/930.html">FileDB</a> class stores and retrives files from a database and the class uses the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/846.html">AnyDB</a> class which is a compatibility layer which allows you to use all sorts of databases (I use MySQL).

To celebrate the opening of my new section I have posted my first file...
The OpenOffice.org logo in svg. After spending many hours looking for this logo in the SVG format I got the EPS version taken from <a href="http://www.ooodocs.org/graphics/1.1/index.html">Version 1.1 Logos and CD Materials</a> converted by a friend in Adobe Illustrator (AI). AI was capable of doing this without errors unlike pstoedit. Se my post: [OpenOffice.org logo][1].
