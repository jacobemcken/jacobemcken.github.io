    Thanks for a great tip. If you need to convert many files, you can do something like:


    find . -name '*.flac' | while read f ; do n=$(basename "$f" .flac) ; d=$(dirname "$f") ; mkdir -p "../Musik_som_mp3/$d" ; gst-launch-0.10 filesrc location="$f" ! flacdec ! audioconvert ! lame ! id3mux name=tag ! filesink location="../Musik_som_mp3/$d/$n.mp3" ; done

I'm extracting all my CD's to flac files but my girlfriend is using iPod and iTunes on Windows which won't play flac files. So I looked into converting all the music to mp3 so she could use it as well. I wanted a way to do it from the command line and I knew [Gstreamer][1] was up for the job:

    gst-launch-0.10 filesrc location="music.flac" ! flacdec ! audioconvert ! lame ! id3mux name=tag v2-tag=true v1-tag=true ! filesink location="music.mp3"

The cool thing is that tags is preserved.

**Note:** Actually first I thought tags wasn't preserved during the the gstreamer conversion, but that was because I used Totem with the Xine backend which apparently cant show mp3 tags.

Now I only need to write a bash script to run through all the music... lets see when I find the time :D
