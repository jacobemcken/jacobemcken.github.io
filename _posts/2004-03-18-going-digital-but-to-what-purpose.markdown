<p>Yesterday I recieved my Digital certificate from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;privat.tdc.dk&#47;digital&#47;">TDC<&#47;a>. TDC provides digital certificates for danish citizents. I succesfully installed it in Firefox and Thunderbird but I'm having trouble when sending emails signed with my certificate.... When I recieve them I'm told that the email can have been altered since it was sent - WTF?!?</p>
<p>Dunno if sending emails throug SPAM assassin, virus scan etc. alters the email so the digital signing fails. Well I hope I find some &uuml;ber geek who can help me out :)</p>
