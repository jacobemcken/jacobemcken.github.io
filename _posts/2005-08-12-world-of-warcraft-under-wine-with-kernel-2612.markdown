After reading a post on some Gentoo forum where someone said that they didn't need the memory hack for Cadega to run World of Warcraft after using kernel 2.6.12, I gave it another shot.

The annoying not-beeing-able-to-click-on-anything-in-game-bug is now gone. So far I havn't played more than 10 minutes but it seems the game just runs as it should :-D

My danish characters has stopped working again, though. But I think it has something to do with Breezy because it worked in Hoary.

Well, running WoW with the newest WINE release and a 2.6.12 kernel in opengl works!

Over and out!
