While I installed <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a> on Ubuntu I went to WINE's website and read some of their weekly newsletters. I must be a sick person because I find a lot of their articles interesting :-)

I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.winehq.org/?issue=258#Pirates!%20Screenshot">a specific one</a> which caught my immediate attention. I guy have been working on DirectX 9, and have troubled him self with making the new Sid Meier's Pirates playable :-D

Some might say that I could use Cedega... but I cant really decide wether I like their initiative???
I would like to see some of Cedega's work be put back into WINE just like <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/">CodeWeavers</a> does with CrossOver Office.

Now I'm waiting for a newer WINE in Ubuntu Hoary... looking forward to the day reboots to Windows just to play a game is just something you look back at and laught.
