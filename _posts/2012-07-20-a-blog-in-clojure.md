I decided to write a blog in [Clojure][1] - my reasons:

  * It is alot more motivating working on something "real" - and I need practice to learn
  * Make [markdown syntax][2] for blog posts a first class citizen. This is is a tough fight with Wordpress (was? - haven't poked at for some time now). Though wysiwyg (html) is just as important... now I just have to figure out a way to make both work well in parallel :D
  * Instead of just storing posts in the database and generating pages dynamic on request, I want the blog to generate static html pages whenever a post is created or updated. The same with comments.

I have put my code on [Github][3] and I'll share my design ideas as it progresses.
