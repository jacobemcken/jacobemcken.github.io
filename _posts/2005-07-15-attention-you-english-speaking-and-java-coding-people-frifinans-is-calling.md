Yesterday I [translated the danish "getting started coding" guide into english][1]. One less excuse for not contributing to [FriFinans][2]. It is all pretty straight forward but if you should get stuck you are more than welcome to contact me.

For those how don know what FriFinans is...
It's an open source multiuser accounting system soon to take over the world ;-)
We have put alot of thoughts in the design fase until now and I'm really proud of the outcome... Frank has been great. I really think FriFinans has a solid and thought through base for the application.

Right now Frank is working on the foundation af advanced history logging, and through that the ability to roll back changes made to objects (ie. a debtor).
