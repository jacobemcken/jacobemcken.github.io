Yesterday I worked with <a href="http://www.mbrix.dk/">Morten Brix Petersen</a> to implement user comments on the <a href="http://www.debianguiden.dk/">Danish Debian guide</a>. User comment functionality like the one found on PHP's documentation. While we where at make enhancements we also redesigned the frontpage to look like the rest of the guide.

First the front page was designed using tableless design but IE and Konqueror (incl. Safari) couldn't handle it. Now the page useses two tables :( not something I'm proud of but hey now it works.

Next target is the layout of the search functionality (<a href="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</a>), which should be integratede with the rest of the guide.
