Yesterday I went to a birthday (grill) party held be a friend of mine from university. I was a great party eventhough it rained and mainly boys attended. Well I had a lot of fun, and a few beers :-D

I talked to a guy there who manages a <a href="http://www.hawks.rif2002.dk/hawks/">floorball team on N&oslash;rrebro in Copenhagen</a>. I will try to pull myself together and contact him and start playing. I have been talking about finding a floorball team for a long time now.

I hope I have the time to both keep dancing breakdance and playing floorball, but if I have to choose breakdance is my priority.
