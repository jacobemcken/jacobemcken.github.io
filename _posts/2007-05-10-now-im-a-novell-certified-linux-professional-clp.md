    a shell script which can be used to start\r\nand stop the web server and the Samba

This week I've been on a course to prepare for the Novell Certified Linux Engineer (CLE) which is required (and payed) by my employer.
But to take the CLE certification test you need to be [CLP certified][1] first, so today I took the CLP certification.
Now I'm ready to do the CLE tomorrow.

I've been working with Linux for some years now so the test wasn't really that hard. Actually I was disappointed that I only got 718 points, I would have expected more. Anyways it is passed so who cares :D Don't know what to expect from tomorrows test, I hope it is as easy as this one.

(Ubuntu is still my preferred Linux distro... but don't tell Novell :P sssshhh)
