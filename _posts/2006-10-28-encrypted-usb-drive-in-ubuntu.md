  content: "Works like a charm :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nA tip:\r\n\r\nBefore setting up LUKS
    on the drive overwrite it with random data in order to slow down an eventually
    attack on the encryption. The vise zealot would also perform a bad blocks scan
    to make sure the hard drive is not going to die too soon ;-) Do this in a single
    command:\r\n\r\n\r\n      badblocks -c 10240 -s -w -t random -v /dev/sda\r\n\r\n\r\nParanoid
    beyond regular self toture? Willing to spend one or two days on the extra security?
    Do this:\r\n\r\n\r\n      dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning:
    This wil definitely make your cpu and harddisk  temprature rise and be in the
    high range the whole time!"

  content: "I dunno.  \r\n\r\nFlash drives have a limited number of read-write cycles.
    \ Making a filesystem (for some filesystems; others may be different), performs
    many repeated writes to superblock pages. \r\n\r\nin some cases you can wear out
    a flashcard just by making a filesystem on it. \r\n\r\nIt's better to loopback-mount
    an image of the proper size, create the filesystem on that, and then just write
    the ready made image to the disk."

    and an usbdrive where i can tell that there IS an encrypted partition.\r\n\r\nCan
    you give me a clue? My googling was unsuccesfull\r\n\r\nthanx"

    If you done all the steps I must admit I don't know what you could have done wrong.
    Does the error persist even after a reboot?

    Just a note. If you encrypt a USB stick you should use ext2 and not ext3 as the latter is very slow on sticks due to the journalling system.

    Great guide. Your instructions worked nearly perfectly. The only  problem I ran into was that the mounted drive had root-only permissions, which is fixed with:
    sudo chown -R myuser:myuser /dev/usbdevicemountpoint


    After that, Gnome's default mount icon was fully accessible.

    Really nice,
    very cool sharing.
    better on Ubuntu 10.04 lts

Today I went to the [Linuxforum BOF day][1] where I attended a session about encrypting your personal files. This made me remember [a post][2] read some time ago (check out the screen cast). I guessed that this functionality would be in Ubuntu Edgy by now so I just went ahead and tried to make my USB pen drive encrypted.

This is how I did it:

1.  First install the needed software

        sudo apt-get install cryptsetup

2.  Make sure your USB disk isn't mounted. Then partition the USB pendrive
    the way you want it, if it isn't already partitioned (I made one big
    partition on mine `/dev/sda1`).
    **Note:** Don't mount the disk afterwards!
3.  If you havn't rebooted your computer since you installed the `cryptsetup` package,
    you might have to load the device mapper crypt module manually:

        sudo modprobe dm-crypt

4.  Now make the partition encrypted:

        $ sudo cryptsetup --verbose --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sda1

        WARNING!
        ========
        This will overwrite data on /dev/sda1 irrevocably.

        Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
        Enter LUKS passphrase:
        Verify passphrase:
        Command successful.

    If you get the error:

        Failed to setup dm-crypt key mapping.
        Check kernel for support for the aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 cipher spec and verify that /dev/sda1 contains at least 133 sectors.

    Make sure that the disk isn't mounted. And make sure you are using the right device. You can use `dmesg` to check which device the disk have been assigned. You might also wanna check that the the module `dm-crypt` is loaded (`lsmod | grep dm`).

5.  Now attach the encrypted partition.:

        $ sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda1 sda1
        Enter LUKS passphrase:
        key slot 0 unlocked
        Command successful.

6.  Now create a filesystem on the new encryptet device:

        sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/sda1

7.  Remove the tempoary device mapped to the encrypted partition:

        sudo cryptsetup luksClose sda1

8.  Now remove the your usbdisk from the USB plug, and reinsert it and Ubuntu should find it and ask for the passphrase.

**Update:** I tried to insert my USB pen into a Ubuntu Dapper (which this guide also would work on I guess). I just thought it was cool that is atcually told me which package it needed to for it to work:
