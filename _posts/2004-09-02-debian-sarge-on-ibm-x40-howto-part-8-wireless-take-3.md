    Led lights are great because they are long lasting and consumes less electricity.,';

I wanted to update my kernel to the 2.6.8 kernel but I had some troubles compiling the Madwifi source code because a change in the kernel source code. I found a patch for the 2.6.8 kernel (only) and a <a href="http://www.linux-wireless.org/Wireless/Install-HOWTO/Drivers/madwifi/madwifi-20040827-linux-2.6.8.1.Patch-Howto.txt">Howto for applying the patch</a>.

In my search around the net for info on my laptop, I found out how to enable the led that indicates activity on the wireless card. Before compiling the driver you have to set an environmental variable:

    export COPTS="$COPTS -DSOFTLED"

Now that I recompiled the driver anyway I enabled the variable and BINGO... now my led lights up as soon the driver is loaded. And thats just the half of it... sometimes it also blinks ;)
Though I havn't testet it under heavy load (to test if the blinking increases under heavy traffic).
HURRAY... I have an extra led blinking on my laptop.
