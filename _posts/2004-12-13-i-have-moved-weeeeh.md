Yesterday I moved all my stuff to me and my girlfriends new apartment. So now I have 100 square meters devided in three rooms + kitchen + bathroom. Some of my friends (Daniel, Kim and Morten) gave me a had with the heavy lifting and I gave them back problems :)

There is plenty of room in that truck...we only have to drive once.
No worries, Michelle (my girlfriend) only have a closet a sleeping coutch and a few boxes.
WAAAAAAGH (that anoying sound when you make a wrong answer in one of the TV shows)

Thanks you guys!

Thanks to my parents too... the have helped us a lot with the new appartment and moving.
