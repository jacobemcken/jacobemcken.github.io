At work we have several servers running Debian anb because we are multiple persones maintaining them we end up having software (packages) installed that no one remember the reason for. I thought I would be of great if apt/dpkg had some build-in preference you could enable so people had to ad a comment why they install the software which they are about to, and the comment would be saved along with a list of the packages installed.
Perhapes if using `sudo` you could also log who is installing what. You cannot trust that people always will leave a name for a number of reasons. I think the two greatest reasons would be:

*   pure laziness
*   hiding that they are about to fuck something up

I have to google around some more, to see if something like this have actually been implemented.

A colleague pointed out that 'rpm' have the ability to roll back you system to a specific day... though havn't tried it so sadly I don't know how well it works. But that would be a great thing to have in 'dpkg' also.
