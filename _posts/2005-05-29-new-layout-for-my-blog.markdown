<p>Yesterday I got an idear for a layout for my weblog, and today I actually took the time to realize it. Though it  looked better inside my head, I'm satisfied with the result. Of course I used [Inkscape][] to implement it.<br />
I have also used some time tweaking the stylesheet to look good with the html generated by markdown... no I will not stop talk about it ;)</p>
<p>[Inkscape]: http:&#47;&#47;www.inkscape.org&#47;</p>
