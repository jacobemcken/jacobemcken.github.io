I have just installed a <a href="http://kernel.org/">2.6.9 kernel</a> and now my laptop wakes after suspend with acpi. But as soon it has awoken it stats to shutdown :(

I have to find out why this happens... but it is getting there YE YE :-D

**Update:** Suspend actually works now. Just me who thinks you have to wake the computer up with the power button. (I had disabled lid-suspend because it didn't work with earlier kernels).
