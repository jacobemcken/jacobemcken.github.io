    X40.\r\nBut the Mac will always be like the girl \"that got away\" - an object
    of envy. ;-)\r\nUntil you get one, that is."

After working alot on-site I found it necessary to buy a laptop. My top demands for a laptop ordered by importance:

<ul>
<li>quality</li>
<li>12" screen</li>
<li>long battry time</li>
<li>not to heavy (well not many if any 12" laptops are)</li>
<li>style</li></ul>
I had a hard time choosing between an Apple Powerbook and IBM Thinkpad but I ended up with a IBM X40 Thinkpad with 512MB RAM 8 cell battery (7.5 hours working time). It also has a build in wireless card supporting the a, b, and g standard, a 10/100/1000 ethernet card and bluetooth. What more can a geek like me wish for :)

Apple is also cool and I really - I mean REALLY like the look and feel of a Power Book and OSX. Apple have great taste in style, and I just love the eye-candy. Now GNU/Linux and GNOME have to do... not that thats going to be a problem, me beeing a Linux and GNOME lover ;)
