Yesterday evening I attended a lecture named "<i><a href="http://www.osl.dk/nyhed/alle_nyheder/debataften_010404/">Open Source - Linux, disruptive technology or cost cutting measure?</i></a>" where <a href="http://www.suse.com/us/company/press/services/information/company/particulars.html">Richard Seibt</a> spoke. There where about 20 people and it was very exciting.
I talked a little bit with him later and he seems like a really great guy.
