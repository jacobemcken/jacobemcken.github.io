After installing a clean Sarge system from an USB key with some of the nightly builds of the new Debian installer I ran into the first troubles.
My keyboard didn't function properly... even though I could write danish characters like "&aelig;&oslash;&aring;", I wasn't able to shift through the virtual consoles with (Ctrl+Alt+F1 - F6).

<pre>dpkg-reconfigure console-data</pre>
revealed that the "specific keymap" was set to "Apple USB".
changing this to "Standard" helped.
