  content: "Thanks, this info is exactly what I needed! But could you fix your links
    so that when I try to copy the destination of \"direct link\" to my clipboard
    (so I can use wget) I actually get the link to the Debian repository instead of:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.emcken.dk/weblog/exit.php?url_id=597&entry_id=127\r\n\r\nWhich
    is a pretty worthless thing to get with wget, as I discovered."

After my [success with installing Ubuntu Breezy][1] I wanted to rip 2 new CD's I got today. But the gstreamer MP3 encoder (`gstreamer0.8-lame`) isn't in the Ubuntu repositories.

I found it at [Marillat's Debian repository][2] ([direct link][3]) where I downloaded it and installed it with:

    rivendell:~# dpkg -i gstreamer0.8-lame_0.8.10-0.1_i386.deb

You also need the package `liblame0`, which is in multiverse:

    rivendell:~# apt-get install liblame0

In the Sound-Juicer in Breezy you can add a MP3 profil from within Sound-Juicer preferences.
You might wanna take a look at an [earlier entry about MP3 ripping in Sound-Juicer][4] in my blog.
