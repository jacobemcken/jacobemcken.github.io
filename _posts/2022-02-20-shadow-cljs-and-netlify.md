Building ClojureScript Single Page Applications (SPA) on [Netlify][1] just
works. The following instructions require no prior knowledge of neither Netlify
nor build tools (like Shadow-cljs, WebPack etc.), but some knowledge about HTML
and Git is expected.


## Setup a ClojureScript SPA project

SPA projects come in all shapes and sizes, causing equal diversity in paths for
compiled code and build commands. Most of the time, differences are small even
subtle. But for an automatic build service (including Netlify) these things
needs to be exactly right. The following description assumes a ClojureScript
project setup matching the [Shadow-cljs "Quick Start" guide][2] (snapshot from
Feb. 17. 2022 - Shadow-cljs v2.17.3).


The result of the "Quick Start" guide summed up:

1. Run `npx create-cljs-project <project-name>` to create a new ClojureScript project
2. Add "Hello World" code
3. Setup a Shadow-cljs build named `frontend`. The same name is used in the
   examples below
4. Add `index.html` page that uses the "Hello World" code

Notice: The link to the "Quick Start" guide is a snapshot to ensure the
instructions found on this page will remain correct. But do checkout the newest
version of the guide as well.

Wrap up the project by pushing the code to a Git repo (Netlify supports GitHub
and GitLab among others.)


## Setup Netlify

From Netlify's "Team overview" click *Add new site*, select *Import from
existing project* and choose the repository and branch created above.

While `npx shadow-cljs watch frontend` is used for that neat "Live update" local
developer experience. All the build optimizations are reserved for "Releasing",
which means a Netlify production build would require the following as its *Build
command*:

    npx shadow-cljs release frontend


For more information about `compile`, `watch` and `release` builds, see [Basic
Workflow][3]. As the project advances (i.e. includes CSS), it is very likely
that the ["script" section of `package.json`][script] should be leveraged
instead of calling `shadow-cljs` directly.


By default, Shadow-cljs puts all JavaScript files it builds in the `public/js`
directory. Files for publishing needs to stay in the same directory, which is
why the "Quick Start" guide gave detailed instructions for `index.html` content
and location. Netlify requires the following as its *Publish directory* to match
the SPA project setup:

    public/


Often several things need to be aligned to get the publishing directory content
just right. Luckily, the above setup is simple ðŸ˜…

Netlify should now look something like this:

<img src="/public/media/Netlify build settings for Shadow-cljs.png" alt="Screenshot of build settings in Netlify" height="465" width="377" style="height:auto" />

Now deploy the SPA and open it in a browser. It will just be a blank page, but
in the *Browser Console* `Hello World` will be printed.

<img src="/public/media/Hosted cljs SPA on Netlify.png" alt="Screenshot of browser with console open showing cljs SPA" height="336" width="801" style="height:auto" />


## Put the URL in control

For more advanced Single Page Applications, it's normal to use a routing library
(e.g. Reitit) and put the URL in control of which "page" is being shown. While
staying in the comfort of the local developer experience, this just works
because the Shadow-cljs webserver will...

> by default ... serve all static files from the configured paths, and fall back
> to index.html when a resource is not found

Source: [Shadow-cljs User Guide][5]


But when the SPA is published on Netlify this is no longer the default behavior.

Luckily, it is easy to add "Rewrite rules" for a Netlify app by adding a file in
the *Publish directory* (`public/_redirects`) with the following content:

```
/* /index.html 200
```

See [Netlify documentation about "Rewrites and proxies"][6].


Now there is no excuse for that awesome ClojureScript SPA not being available
online ðŸ˜‰
