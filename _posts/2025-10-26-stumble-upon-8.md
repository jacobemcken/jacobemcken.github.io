I reflect on AI from time to time,
and though I don't see how it will replace me in the near future,
it is worth keeping an eye on.

Right now, I just want to share an AI-related Substack post called:
[The 4 Rare Leadership Skills We Need More Than Ever In The AI Era][1]
by Shane Snow. The post really resonated with me.

Time will tell if he is actually on to something or if I just hope he is. 🤷
I do wish we had more honest and emphatic leaders in general

Maybe I will share more of my own thoughts on AI in a future blog post.
