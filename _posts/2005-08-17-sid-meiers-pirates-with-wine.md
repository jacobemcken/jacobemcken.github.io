    believe that the consumer doesnt have to buy another \r\n$50 game just to get
    the serial code when he already bought one and lost the cd key. Asking customer
    support at ataris website replies that you should buy another version because
    they dont supply ANY CD KEYS TO CUSTOMERS.\r\nThis gets them more money by buying
    another version.\r\nI hate companys like this, They are all the same."

    Dang, I have been searching the internet high and low for someone who talks about ubuntu in plain english instead of tech forums.


    Also, I would like to add a comment before brandon nixon's comment

A few days ago i tried to make [Sid Meiers Pirates][2] run again with [WINE][3].

As usual when trying to install the game I got the following:

<img src="/public/media/Pirates/Piratesinstallerror.png" alt="" />

Well that didn't stop me this time. I started to copy Pirates from my Windows XP partition to my fake WINE Windows drive (notice the cool new GNOME 2.12 copy dialog.

<img width='410' height='226' style="border: 0px;padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px" src="/public/media/Pirates/Screenshot-Copyingfiles.png" alt="" />

Now I tried to start Pirates again but this time I got a message about missing 2 dll files:

*   msvcp71.dll
*   msvcr71.dll

You can find them by searching on [Google][1]

I copied the files to my fake Windows' system folder ie. `/home/je/c/windows/system`.

Finally I applied a No-CD-patch and was now able to start the game, where I was greeted by a... black screen for a long time.

I'm serious.... a VERY long time.

I'm telling you - it's still there ;)

Then finally I was presented with the title menu. YEAH!

<a href='/public/media/Pirates/Piratesrunning.png'><img width='110' height='83' style="border: 0px;padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px" src="/public/media/Pirates/Piratesrunning.thumb.png" alt="" /></a>

I think I fiddled a little with some settings before I dared try starting the game.
Now a long waiting time again. But you don't wanna go fetch coffe because you want to see this ;)

Woah, I see an ingame movie... cool. I was so quickly taking the screenshot, that the menu didn't get time to disappear. They call my Lucky Luke ;-)

<a href='/public/media/Pirates/Gotpastthetitlemenu-w00t.png'><img width='110' height='83' style="border: 0px;padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px" src="/public/media/Pirates/Gotpastthetitlemenu-w00t.thumb.png" alt="" /></a>

I'm actaully able to choose with whom I want to got to the new world. The grey man was a little to creepy so England it was.

<a href='/public/media/Pirates/Selectingcountry.png'><img width='110' height='83' style="border: 0px;padding-left: 5px;padding-right: 5px" src="/public/media/Pirates/Selectingcountry.thumb.png" alt="" /></a>

Long wait time.... again, and no movie of me fighting the captain - perhaps I accidentally hit a key, dunno.
Well suddenly I saw a little ship sailing and joy filled my body - YES!... and before I knew it the game had crashed. :-( Perhaps tweaking with the video setting and stuff might make the game somewhat playable :-)

The few screenshots I created was worth it all. See you on the other side.
