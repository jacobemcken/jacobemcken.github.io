I think its kinda hidden. You might have wondered why vmware-server kernel modules was available from the repositories but no vmware-server? The answer is: It is available!

Just like Real Player, Opera and other commercial software you can install VMware-server from the following repository, which you add to `System -> Administration -> Software Sources` and `Third-Party Software`:

    deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu feisty-commercial main

After that you run:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install vmware-server

A colleague pointed me a page about adding [Adding Canonical Commercial
Repositories][1] in Ubuntu, which is actually referenced from the [page about
Installtion VMware Server in Ubuntu][2].
