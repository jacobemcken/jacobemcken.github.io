  content: "Sorry for not being clear... I know about the dependencies ;)\r\n\r\nWhat
    I dont understand is why Suse have made the choice to make hb_gui an integral
    part of their package and not just an optional/recommended package."

When I install a server I usually make a minimal install and put on the software which is needed for the task the machine is to perform. Less packages which needs security updates the better IMO. Today I was setting up a heartbeat cluster on a SLES10. When the heartbeat package is installed the system also installs shaitloads of other packages like gtk pango and some X-libs... and I simply dont get why?!?

It feels so Windows like.... eeeeekkk.

Sorry just had to get it out.
