Several times I have had "great fun" converting filenames from the old 8-bit locales to use the new UTF-8 locales. Everytime, I used some time to find find a tool for it because everytime I forget the name of the tool `convmv`.
The fuckup usually shows itself on the file server (Samba) where the users happily uses &aelig;&oslash;&aring; for filenames.

Now I'll blog about so hopefully next time I can remember the name of the tool or atleast just make a search on my blog.

Debian has packages in their repository bu for SLES you need to download the tool manually. I found the tool on [download.com][1]
