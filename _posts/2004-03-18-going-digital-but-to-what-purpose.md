Yesterday I recieved my Digital certificate from <a href="http://privat.tdc.dk/digital/">TDC</a>. TDC provides digital certificates for danish citizents. I succesfully installed it in Firefox and Thunderbird but I'm having trouble when sending emails signed with my certificate.... When I recieve them I'm told that the email can have been altered since it was sent - WTF?!?

Dunno if sending emails throug SPAM assassin, virus scan etc. alters the email so the digital signing fails. Well I hope I find some &uuml;ber geek who can help me out :)
