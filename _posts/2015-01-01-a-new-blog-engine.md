For a long time I have wanted to find an alternative to [Wordpress][1]. It felt
like an obstacle which needed overcoming every time I had an idea for a blog
post. The result being that I didn't get any posts published (I have a few
drafts which I never finished).

My own [Clojure blog adventure][2] was more about my trying to learn the Clojure
language, and would probably have some of the same issues I experienced with
Wordpress. Also when I stumbled on [Jekyll][3] my own blog project got
subconsciously shelved, because it already implemented all my ideas so much
better.

Apart from Markdown being a first class citizen, the blog can now be hosted on
[GitHub Pages][4].

Anyways all my old blog posts have now been migrated to Jekyll and the revamped
layout now looks sufficiently good and works on mobile devices so I feel
confident making a first release. I have "cheated" and based the design on the
Jekyll theme called [Hyde][5].

You are now looking at the result... lets see if this actually help on my post
frequency :)
