    WINE... though you have to patch and compile yourself :-(\r\n\r\nBut it is doable
    if you put some energy into it ;)"

  content: You should aim for a higer goal, which translates into aiming for level
    60.  I thought at first that it was impossible to reach 59, and now that i've
    reached that level, I'm going to be saving every game I play with WOW.  Good luck
    to us all.

  content: "I just bought WoW, and I'm glad to find out that I'm not the only one
    who can't play it under Linux. Unfortunately, I am too poor to be able to afford
    a dedicated webserver (I can't even justify the $20 cost of a real domain name
    to myself), so I have to make the tough choice between playing WoW and my website
    being up =[.\r\n\r\nI guess my website's going down =]."

After the 1.8.0 patch World of Warcraft doesn't work for me again. I'm unable to click on things ingame :-( (This applies to the latest 1.8.1 patch too).

This sucks because now I have to boot into Windows again.

Anyways, I have played alot the last few weeks and have become level 53. I might hit level 60 before Christmas... YEAH! I'm not going to set higher goals... my girlfriend might not like it ;-)

I have been reading more on the items and quests in the game, and I'm begining to realize that I wont ever get near some of the really cool stuff :-(
