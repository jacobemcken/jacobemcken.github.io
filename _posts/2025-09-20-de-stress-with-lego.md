The last couple of years, I've been finding stress at work more often than I'd like.
Apparently, experiencing problems, having the skill to address it,
but not being allowed to, is something that really gets to me.

So much that I don't even feel like working on
side projects, open source and writing posts on my blog.

*Enter Lego*

A year ago, I started buying mixed second-hand Lego collections.
Then I would go through the process
of figuring out which Lego sets are making up the collection,
which bricks are missing, order the missing bricks on Bricklink,
wash it, assemble it to finally disassemble it again before storing it.

This routine became a ritual for de-stressing.
With no deadlines or enforced processes that stifle efficiency,
I can do a thorough job - it is very appealing.

I enjoyed Lego immensely as a kid, so it feels like coming home after 30-35 years.

This last <abbr title="My Own Creation">MOC</abbr> came out so well that I want to share it publicly.

It started out with the idea to build some columns (possibly Greek),
and I stumbled upon a [brick-and-iron fence on Pinterest][1] by Hannah Abraham.

Not having the exact same bricks forced me to improvise:

After stepping away from building (and getting some sleep),
a couple of ideas started to take shape, leading to a second iteration:

I stole the build for the sailboat from [@BuilderFamily on YouTube][2].

Pretty happy with the result ðŸ˜Ž
