Today at work over lunch I read an article in [Linux Magazine][1] called Pimped Prompt.

It inspired me to try different stuff out. I often missed an indication on when I was doing different stuff in the terminal... this is what I ended up with:

    export PS1='\[\e[0;34m\][\@\e[1D]\[33[0m\] \u@\h:\w\$ '

{% include image-caption.html src="/public/media/prompt.png" description="This is how it looks like." %}

To make it permanent put it in your `.bashrc` file in your home directory. Remember that this variable is propably already set so you either need to replace the line or instert closer to the bottom of the file.
