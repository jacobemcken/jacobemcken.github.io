It just looks amazing when things are neatly organized,
so of course, I wanted some crisp-looking labels for my drawers with LEGO.

There’s a cool solution for those in possession of an actual label printer,
but since that isn't me, I needed something a bit more "generic".

Having flirted with Inkscape in a previous lifetime,
I turned to <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>.

At [Brick Architect][1] by Tom Alphin you can find labels
that fit well with some printers made specifically for labels.
The source graphic hides deep in the downloadable files as old-school `bmp` image files,
but their resolution is not that impressive.

Since my LEGO collection is fairly modest,
I only need labels representing overall categories like (normal) bricks, plants, tiles, plates, etc.
With Inkscape and heavy inspiration from Tom’s work,
I have recreated six bricks in SVG.

Since others might be in the same boat as me,
I thought I'd share my (manual) work as
<a href="/public/files/Scaleable monochrome LEGO bricks.zip">a zip file</a>.

From what I understand,
Tom uses LDraw to create these files for the label printers.
I wonder if I can leverage LDraw to generate SVGs as well.

But that is for another day.
