<p>Today I looked into converting EPS to SVG because it seems that EPS is the only vector graphic format the OpenOffice.org logos can be found in... sad but true :'(</p>
<p>I found that the tool `pstoedit` can do the job so I tested it:</p>
<p>    pstoedit -f plot-svg my.eps my.svg</p>
<p>The result was not to my satisfaction!<br />
At least `Sodipodi` and `Inkscape` can't display the SVG result - I'll find out when I get to try out Batik. If it's a bad conversion (as I suspect) I'll find a way to try if Adobe Illustrator is any better.</p>
<p>Another workaround was to remake the logo myself. It's only the name and two gulls - come on give me a challenge.<br />
How about this:<br />
Buy the font used for the logo for 22$ WTF?!?<br />
(did I mention that the logo uses two different fonts?)</p>
<p>Hmmm it seems that I'm back at trying to convert the damn EPS.</p>
