  infrastructure :)\r\nI got wires running all over, and my little trusty server makes
  to much noice. I would like to hook up all my clients (2 workstations and a laptop)

  my floor. I have been playing around with the thought of of trashing my current
  server totally, and find a new one wich is more home friendly (less power and noise).
  Even though webalizer tells me I have 1.5G traffic to emcken.dk each month, its
  not like I need a 2.0GHz processor and 1GB ram for it.\r\n\r\nI have searched the

  content: Try lighttpd - it's truly great.  I almost bought an nslu2, but decided
    I would build a cheap desktop (cheap being relative, it was ~$300) with 500gb
    storage, cheap/slow/cool AMD sempron 2800+, 1gb ram.  Runs all my assorted
    file servings (http,ssh2,samba,nfs), teamspeak, works as a mythtv backend, and
    let's me startx to play wow every now and then.  I use an XBOX as the media front
    end for televisions, as well as stream to my laptop.  Quite handy.

Trough the last year I have been really wanting to do something to my home infrastructure :)
I got wires running all over, and my little trusty server makes to much noice. I would like to hook up all my clients (2 workstations and a laptop) to a wireless network, maybe even my server, to get rid of all the wires cluttering my floor. I have been playing around with the thought of of trashing my current server totally, and find a new one wich is more home friendly (less power and noise). Even though webalizer tells me I have 1.5G traffic to emcken.dk each month, its not like I need a 2.0GHz processor and 1GB ram for it.

I have searched the net for devices which could help me do what I want with a minimum of devices. Beneath I have gathered all I found out so far but first I want to sum up my list of my requirements.

Here is what I want my home network and computers to do:

*   Linux server
    *   Minimum noise
    *   Minimum power consumption
    *   Fair amount of disk space (minimum 60GB)
    *   Apache / PHP / MySQL (for my website / blog)
    *   Samba server (to share files to my Windows machines)
*   Wireless access
*   IP telephony
*   A firewall
    *   Preferable Linux
    *   With the possibility for QoS / traffic shaping to make IP phone work under heavy network load.

In the future I might want the following:

*   Support for [Slimdevices][1] and their [slimserver][2]
*   Support for multimedia streaming server like MythTV and stuff
*   Have a running [Teamspeak][3] server

## Wireless

My first wireless was a Zyxel 2000. Spec's was what I needed and the design of the actual access point was good. Random disconnects and the need for power cycling the acces point made me look for something new. Then I bought a [Linksys WRT54GL][1] on [Fon][2]'s website and tried that one out. FON is a really cool wireless community. Go read about them... you might like it.

I wasn't able to open port ranges in the firewall on the Linksys using the FON firmware. So I tried a firmware from the [OpenWRT project][3] which FON actually builds upon for their Linksys WRT54GL devices. Linux on small devices rocks.

For some reason I had a high latency when playing World of Warcraft on the wireless... I never got the time to look into this before I stumbled upon another project using the OpenWRT project as base: [Coova][4]. Coova is a really cool project even though I had some issuses with it. Before I found the solution to the problem, which I later learned was caused by mysellf my colleague [Tomas Krag][5] had already introduced me to "La Fonera", the latest access point from [Fon][3]. It is small, looks really slick and the wireless connections is very stable... so I'm gonna stick with this one for now.

## The server

I have been looking a various possible server alternatives to my current "slim desktop PC" server.

First I thought about building a micro-atx machine. Though I would really like to make my server as small, noise free and with as low power consumption as possible. Then I thought I'd use my Lynksys WRT54GL, but it doesn't have enought diskspace for my websites. Then I looked at different NAS solutions like [Thecus N2100][6], and in the end I stumbled upon the [Linksys NSLU2][7]. You can install [linux on the Linksys NSLU2][8], you can attach USB disks, its small and it is cheap :-D

I'm not sure if the processor is powerful enough. One of my mates reminded me that might be able to use alternatives to Apache which is more lightweight. Anyways I think I'm gonna buy one and find out for my self. For disk space I'd buy a laptop disk (2,5"). Perhaps a Seagate disk in a [RaidSonic Icybox closure][9]. It seems people have made the slimserver run on it which is cool. Don't know if it can run a Teamspeak and it can't run as a MythTV box for sure. But I might wanna make a separate box for all that multimedia stuff later on, perhaps based on micro or nano ATX motherboard.

## The other stuff

I already go an IP telephone, or an [IP2analog][10] converter. Which works okay, good enough for me anyway.
About the firewall I might want to use my current Linksys WRT54GL as firewall behind my Zyxel 650 router provided by ISP. The Zyxel 650 doesn't use a normal RJ45 plug for the wan interface. I hope I will be able to find a device with a decent firewall and QoS / traffic shaping that can replace my Zyxel 650. So I don't have to use 2 devices to get router and firewall functionality.
