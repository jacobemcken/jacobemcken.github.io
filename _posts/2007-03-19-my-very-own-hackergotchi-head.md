<img width='80' height='77' style="float: left;" src="/public/media/ubuntu_forum_avatar.gif" alt="" />Last week I found this Avatar while browsing the Ubuntu community forums.  I really like the style and decided to make one myself which should also look kinda like me.

<img width='100' height='100' style="float: left;" src="/public/media/hackergotchi.png" alt="" />The result is my own personal "hand drawed" hackergotchi. I used a picture taken at work and [Inkscape][1] to do the magic. It might look even better if I applied an uneven stroke like the one from the Ubuntu forums. Right now Inkscape does the stroke which is kinda dull. But it will suffice for now.
