We need electronic devices — like phones and computers — that we can trust,
but with everything happening right now, America doesn’t exactly inspire trust.

I think Thibault Martin captures what is needed spot on in his blog post:
[Prosthetics that don't betray][1].

I've always believed the public sector would benefit immensely
from prioritizing Open Source — though not in the short term.
Transitioning from one system to another always comes with challenges,
but closed-source software vendors seem to have convinced the public sector
that these problems are permanent.
At least in Denmark, where Microsoft is everywhere and has been for decades.

I hope this is going to be the the pebble that starts a landslide.
Though, I will not be holding my breath 😅

Speaking of Open Source, I was happy to see that
when [someone asked for guidance on creating presigned URLs in Clojure][2],
I didn’t have to promote [my own Open Source library][3]
— someone else did it for me.
It’s nice to see others benefiting from it. ♥️

Oh, and [GNOME][4] is still an awesome desktop environment.
