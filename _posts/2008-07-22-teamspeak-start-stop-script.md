After my server was restarted twice by my hosting center I decided to make sure [Teamspeak][1] would start automatically.
I read a few posts on how other people did it but in the end I decided that I created my own minimal script.

My two goals with this init script was:

  * Run the Teamspeak server as an unprivileged user.
  * Make sure the Teamspeak server starts up after reboot even though it wasn't shut down properly
  * A little bonus was that it reuses much of the init script that is bundled with the installation

Init script (/etc/init.d/teamspeak):

    #!/bin/sh

    TEAMSPEAK_DIR=/usr/local/teamspeak
    TEAMSPEAK_USER=teamspeak

    # Make sure that Teamspeak starts even though it wasn't closed nicely last time (ie. by a power cut)
    if [ $(su - $TEAMSPEAK_USER -c "ps ux" |grep tsserver2.pid|grep -v grep|wc -l) -eq 0 ] && [ -f ${TEAMSPEAK_DIR}/tsserver2.pid ]
    then
        rm ${TEAMSPEAK_DIR}/tsserver2.pid
    fi

    cd ${TEAMSPEAK_DIR}
    su - $TEAMSPEAK_USER -c "./teamspeak2-server_startscript $1"
    cd -
