Informative error message... NOT.

I've installed php-gtk on a machine and got the above error when trying to start php from cli via ssh.

After a while it suddenly hit me that I hadn't forwarded X when I logged in via ssh. After that I was able to use php again.
php with php-gtk is unable to start without a X server.
