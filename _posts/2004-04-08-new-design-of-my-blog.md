<img style='border:0px;margin:5px;float:left;vertical-align: top' src='/public/media/Emcken.dk_logo.thumb.png' alt='' /> I have be thinking og making a new layout for my blog (and my emcken.dk) homepage. I have drawed a draft for a logo. The face should resemble me and if it looks okay ins SVG I'll use it as a "signature" / "trademark" / "I-was-here" thing. I'll try make it in SVG later this week. Perhapes I will soon update my blog to the 0.6(RC1) version. Who know?!

The next few days I will be at a net party with a lot of my friends :)

Just letting you know that I'm still alive and kicking
